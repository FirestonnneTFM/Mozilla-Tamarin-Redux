/*
	Rules of the game:
	
	-- no ifdefs; all calls for Debugger/Debug are all present (though perhaps stubbed)

	-- all types must be opaque, with accessors required (some accessors might
		have an inline implementation in a separate file, but that's an implementation detail)
	
	-- there are conversion routines for lots of the opaque types in avmplus.h
		(e.g. AvmMethod<->MethodEnv) but these are intended as temporary impedance matchers;
		code outside of AVM itself should wean itself away from these

	-- someday, should compile without requiring avmplus.h; design with that in mind

	-- C++ is fine, but strive for simple, normal function calls rather than class hierarchies. in particular,
		avoid the need (por possibility) of the client subclasses any provided classes.
