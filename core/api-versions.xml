<!--

This is a strawman for how we specify version compatibility for the player.

Player API versions are associated with the set of attributes that defines 
incompatible changes to that API. At a minimum this set incudes the release 
of the player. In Argo we will likely add two more attributes: product 
(Player and AIR) and profile (Desktop and SmartPhone). This set of attributes
can change over time. Note however, even if attributes are dropped from
the specification, they must remain in the compatibility matrix forever.

The list of attributes within its parent defines the compatiblity relationship
between those attributes. Release 10.1.52 is compatible with 10.1.62, but not 
vice-versa. A particular profile and release of Player is compatible with the
same profile and release of AIR, but not vice-versa. 

The leaf elements are always version specifications. These must be unique
but do not have to be in any particular order. 

From this xml we generate AS code that defines a compatibility matrix.
This code is embedded in the release of Flash runtime glue and used by
ASC and AVM to control the visibility of names in the API.
