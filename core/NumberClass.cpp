		// The ARM architecture saves transistors by not implementing subnormal floating point numbers in
		// hardware.  Instead, those values produce a trap ("bounce") so that they can be emulated in software.
		// There is, however, a "RunFast" mode that suppresses the "bounce" and instead does a
		// "flush-to-zero" on underflow.  Some platforms operate in RunFast mode by default and while it
		// is possible for user code to turn off that mode, it seems to be in the OS's purview to install
		// the trap handler.  Long story short, on certain ARM-based platforms, values smaller than the smallest
		// normalized floating point value are snapped (flushed) to zero.
		// 
		// The definitive reference URLs appear to be perishable, but the terms in quotes above are useful in searches:
		//      http://www.google.com/search?q=ARM+runfast+flush-to-zero+bounce
		//
		// The issue seems specific to ARM processors (though perhaps other mobilized cores as well), but will only occur
		// if the platform opts not to install an emulator trap.  So we dynamically find the smallest value, being wary of
		// techniques that might be optimized away by compilers (and especially cross-compilers!).
