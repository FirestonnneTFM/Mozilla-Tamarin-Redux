	// returning uint64_t here rather than uintptr_t is a trick: normally
	// we provide both GPR and FPR versions of calls, on the theory that
	// this is necessary to ensure the return value is always correct. in practice,
	// this seems to be a mostly defunct assumption, as every architecture we're interested
	// in returns values in registers (or register pairs), whether the result is fp or not.
	// still, this dichotomy has been maintained, mostly because it works and
	// hasn't been to painful. with new, table-based thunks this becomes hard to implement,
	// though, as a given IMT thunk can contain both kinds of calls, but C++ can't define
	// a function to return multiple types... however, in practice (as mentioned before) 
	// this seems to mostly be an historical artifact, with a notable exception of 
	// 32-bit NJ_SOFTFLOAT systems (eg ARM without VFP) -- if the compiler decides not
	// to tail-call (MSVC, I'm looking at you), the upper word of the softfloat result
	// can theoretically be clobbered by the compiler. declaring the result as uint64_t 
	// quietly ensures that won't be the case.
	//
	// admittedly, this is a bit fragile, but seems to be the least-objectionable
	// solution to this issue at the present time.
