   This file defines the feature set for avmplus.

   It is also a program to transform the feature definition into three files:

     * a C++ header file, avmfeatures.h
     * a C++ source file, avmfeatures.cpp
     * a Python file, ../build/avmfeatures.py


   The feature set is defined as an XML (really E4X) datum, see below.

   Grammar for feature definitions.

       features           ::= "<features>" feature* at-least-one* at-most-one* exactly-one* "</features>"
       feature            ::= "<feature>" desc name defines+ precludes* requires* "</feature>"
                            | "<tweak>" desc name default defines+ precludes* requires* "</tweak>"
       desc               ::= "<desc>" TEXT "</desc>"
       name               ::= "<name>" TEXT "</name>"
       default            ::= "<default> "true" | "false" "</default>"
       defines            ::= "<defines>" TEXT "</defines>"
       precludes          ::= "<precludes>" TEXT "</precludes>"
       requires           ::= "<requires>" TEXT | at-most-one | at-least-one | exactly-one "</requires>"
       at-least-one       ::= "<at-least-one>" name+ "</at-least-one>"
       at-most-one        ::= "<at-most-one>" name+ "</at-most-one>"
       exactly-one        ::= "<exactly-one>" name+ "</exactly-one>"
       TEXT               ::= space* [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]* space*

       Clause ordering is not significant anywhere and xml comments are
       allowed everywhere.  Leading and trailing whitespace in each element
       is ignored.

   Semantics:

       Features are compile time constraints that select and deselect
       aspects of the virtual machine code.  At compile time, a value
       (off or on) must be provided for every feature, there are no
       default values.

       A FEATURE clause defines a named feature, named by its NAME clause
       and described in human terms by its DESC clause.

         NOTE: A good description is absolutely essential.  It should
         state what the feature does, but also what the implications of
         selecting or deselecting it might be.

       A TWEAK clause defines a named feature with a default value, which
       provides an opportunity for workarounds for bugs and other very
       minor issues.  TWEAKs should be used sparingly (and if they are
       abused because it's convenient to introduce default values then
       the default value facility will be removed).

       No two FEATUREs or TWEAKSs may name the same feature.

       Feature names named by PRECLUDES, REQUIRES, AT-LEAST-ONE, and
       AT-MOST-ONE clauses must be defined by some FEATURE.

       A PRECLUDES clause in a FEATURE adds a constraint that the
       precluded feature cannot be turned on if the feature defined by
       the present FEATURE is turned on.

       A REQUIRES clause in a FEATURE adds a constraint that the
       required feature must be turned on if the feature defined by
       the present FEATURE is turned on.

       A DEFINES clause in a FEATURE names a preprocessor macro that is
       defined (with a simple "#define X") if the FEATURE is turned on.
       This seems redundant until you consider that a FEATURE can define
       multiple macros; this allows discrimination internally in the
       module to be organized differently than feature definition
       externally.

       An AT-LEAST-ONE clause adds a constraint that at least one of
       the features has been turned on.

       An AT-MOST-ONE clause adds a constraint that at most one of the
       features has been turned on.  (The same can be expressed by
       PRECLUDES clauses but that would be more error-prone.)

       EXACTLY-ONE is an abbreviation for the combination of AT-LEAST-ONE
       and AT-MOST-ONE.

   This program processes the feature definition below to check static
   constraints and produce the C++ header file core/avmfeatures.h; that
   header file checks compile-time constraints and defines preprocessor
   macros as appropriate.

   The product's feature settings are imported through VMPI.h; see comments
   in that file for how to provide the settings.

   This program also produces a C++ compilation unit (.cpp file) that
   contains a single string that lists the features that were enabled at
   build time; it is used by the AVM shell for debugging purposes.

   This program also produces a Python file that is used by the cross-platform
   build system to handle configuration switches; see ../configure.py.

  </feature>

  <feature>
    <desc> Selects an architecture that allows load/store of unaligned 16- and 32-bit ints.

        While it's OK for an unaligned int load or store to be slower than an aligned load
        or store, we require that:

          - an unaligned load/store MUST NOT generate a run-time fault, and
          - an unaligned load/store MUST be at least as efficient as separate instructions
            to load and assemble the word one byte at a time / disassemble and store one
            byte at a time.

        If you cannot guarantee that the requirements are met then DO NOT enable
        this feature.  (For example, on Palm Pre unaligned loads/stores are allowed but 
        they're reportedly so slow that they're pointless.)

        Code that uses this feature MUST NOT use it as a license to load/store floating-point
        data using integer instructions, since in general that will not work.  In
        particular this classical pattern will not work:

            uint8_t* p = ...;  // possibly-unaligned address we're loading from
            union (
                float f;
                uint32_t i;
            ) u;
        #ifdef VMCFG_UNALIGNED_INT_ACCESS
            u.i = *(uint32_t*)p;
            return u.f;
        #else
            ...

        The reason it won't work is that some compilers (notably on ARM) will generate
        code that uses a floating-point load into an FP register, so the code actually
        needs unaligned floating-point loads to be supported, AVMSYSTEM_UNALIGNED_FP_ACCESS.
        (Whether it is correct for the compiler to generate that code is beside the point.)

        The prohibition applies to 64-bit loads/stores as well (expressed as pairs of
        uint32_t loads/stores): ARM compilers as of October 2011 will rewrite a pair of loads 
        into a uint32_t array in a union with a return of a double from the union as a single
        double load into the return register.  See comments throughout the code as well
        as Bugzilla 569691 and 685441.

  <feature>
    <desc> Selects an architecture that allows load/store of unaligned 32- and 64-bit floats.
    
        While it's OK for an unaligned floating-point load/store to be slower than an aligned
        load/store, we require that:

          - an unaligned load/store MUST NOT generate a run-time fault, and
          - an unaligned load/store MUST be at least as efficient as separate instructions
            to load and assemble the datum one byte at a time / disassemble and store one
            byte at a time.

        If you cannot guarantee that the requirements are met then DO NOT enable
        this feature.

        Note that if AVMSYSTEM_UNALIGNED_FP_ACCESS is not set then it is assumed that 64-bit
        floats require 8-byte alignment.

            There is a performance penalty to enabling this; clients that want
            maximal execution performance and don't care about debugging should
            disable it.

            If you enable the debugger you may want to consider enabling support for
            specific language strings for error messages in order to avoid getting
            them all.  See the AVMPLUS_ERROR_LANG_ macros in core/ErrorConstants.h.

   <desc> AVMFEATURE_SELFTEST enables the built-in selftests.  These can be run by -Dselftest
          at the shell or by calling the global function avmplus::selftests(), see extensions/Selftest.h.
          Mostly they are useful for AVM development, not for embedders.

          Apart from code size considerations this can be enabled for release builds.  </desc>

    <desc> Selects locking around calls to the memory block manager (GCHeap), allowing multiple
           threads to share the block manager.  Any client with more than one thread that uses
           MMgc either for garbage collected or manually managed memory wants this; the Flash
           Player requires it.  </desc>

  <feature>
    <desc> Make MMgc's overridden global new and delete operators delegate allocation and
           deallocation to VMPI_alloc and VMPI_free instead of going to FixedMalloc.

           Whether you want this or not probably depends on the performance of the
           underlying malloc and might depend on memory consumption patterns.  On desktop
           systems you probably want this to be disabled.  </desc>
    <name> AVMFEATURE_USE_SYSTEM_MALLOC </name>
    <defines> MMGC_USE_SYSTEM_MALLOC </defines>
  </feature>

  <feature>
    <desc> Support C++ exceptions in the MMgc API.  At the time of writing (Apr 2009)
           this means decorating the global new and delete operator with appropriate 'throw'
           clauses.  It is unlikely to mean anything more, as AVM+ and MMgc do not use and
           do not generally support C++ exceptions.

           Note that even if this is enabled, the global new and delete operators may
           not throw exceptions when memory can't be allocated, because the out-of-memory
           handling in MMgc may take precedence.

           FixedMalloc never throws an exception for a failed allocation. </desc>

  <feature>
    <desc> Recognize a pointer or pointer-like value into anywhere in an object as referencing
           that object during marking in the garbage collector.

           Enabling this tends to be increase GC cost but it can be a useful debugging aid. </desc>

    <defines> MMGC_INTERIOR_PTRS </defines>

  <feature>
   <desc> Enable interfacing to Java so you can access java methods/properties like
          native AS properties; e.g.
             var hello = JObject.create("java.lang.String", " hello world ");

  <feature>
    <desc> If enabled then always divert avmStackAlloc() to a separately managed stack,
           to avoid blowing the stack on small systems or to support systems that
           don't provide alloca().  If disabled then smallish allocations are handled
           by the built-in alloca() (which must be provided) and larger allocations
           are handled by diverting to a separately managed stack; the latter case is
           mainly a security issue, as alloca() will do strange things if given sufficiently
           large requests.  </desc>
    <name> AVMFEATURE_HEAP_ALLOCA </name>
    <defines> AVMPLUS_HEAP_ALLOCA </defines>
  </feature>

  <feature>
    <desc> Enabling this will cause the mmfx_* memory macros to use global new/delete.
        By default we use specialized new/delete operators and avoid global new/delete.  However
        this requires some tricks to get multiple inheritance and private destructors to work
        so some codebases may want to use the simpler path of overriding global new/delete.
        Note that this feature works independently of AVMFEATURE_USE_SYSTEM_MALLOC.
