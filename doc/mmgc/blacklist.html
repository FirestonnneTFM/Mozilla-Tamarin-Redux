<h1><center>GC Blacklist Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<P>The blacklist feature attempts to answer the question "Why isn't
the GC collecting my object?".  It does this by allowing objects to be
registered with the GC and then printing the "back pointer chain" of
those objects after a GC collection.<P>

<P>A back pointer chain is the list of objects that connect the object
in question to a GC root.  There may be many paths from the roots to
this object, we just print out the one the GC actually traversed. <P>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Enable AVMTWEAK_HEAP_GRAPH in the avmhost-features.h header (or avmshell-features.h for the shell).</LI>
<LI>Make sure you are on a mac or windows machine and your build has debugging symbols</LI>
<LI>Set the MMGC_PROFILE=1 env var to 1 when launching the process</LI>
<LI>Add calls to GC::addToBlacklist in your program for the objects in question</LI>
</UL>


<h2>Example</h2>

TBD
