<title>Cookbook for Exact GC</title>

<body>
<h1><center>How to Annotate your Classes for Exact GC
<br>
(Cookbook)</center></h1>

<p>MMgc provides opt-in "exact GC" of classes, which means that the GC will:
<ul>
<li> only examine those field of the exactly traced instances that are designated as
"pointer-containing", and
<li> expect the instances, the pointer fields, and the code that
manipulates them to obey certain rules.
</ul>

<P><u>The benefit of exact GC</u> is less time spent in GC, and
less misidentification of garbage as live storage.  <u>The cost of
exact GC</u> is that the class definitions must be annotated, and
the code must follow the rules.

<p>This document tells you what you need to do to opt-in to exact
GC for a class.  Some complicated cases are not covered here:  
This is a brief version of the full writeup
(<a href="exactgc-manual.html">exactgc-manual.html</a>), and there
is exhaustive documentation about annotations at the top
of <a href="../../utils/exactgc.as"><tt>utils/exactgc.as</tt></a>
and <a href="../../utils/nativegen.py"><tt>utils/nativegen.py</tt></a>.


<h2>Remember "the Rules"</h2>

<p><a href="exactgc-manual.html#rules">Recall the rules</a> for a class opting into being exactly traced:

<ul>
<li>The class <em>must</em> disclose (by means of
    annotations) <em>all</em> its GC-pointer fields to the garbage
    collector, including fields in member structures.

<li>A GC-pointer field's value, after tag stripping, <em>must</em> be either
    <tt>NULL</tt> or a pointer to the beginning of a <em>live</em> GC-allocated
    object.

<li>An exactly traced class <em>must</em> derive from GCTraceableObject,
    GCFinalizedObject, or RCObject.  It <em>must not</em> derive from
    GCObject, or from no GC class at all.

<li>A class can be exactly traced only if its base class is exactly
    traced.
</ul>


<h2>The things you must do</h2>

<p>You must do these things:

<ul>

<li>You must annotate the C++ class whose instances are to be exactly
traced.  (This is the bulk of the work.)

<li>If the C++ class is the implementation for an AS3 native class
then you must annotate the AS3 class too by changing its "native"
metadata.

<li>You must turn on exact GC for all instances of the type
as you allocate them.

<li>You must regenerate the "tracing methods" by running a script.
(We will make that part of the build process).

<li>If you changed any AS3 classes you also must rebuild the builtins.
(That's already part of the build process in the Flash Player.)

</ul>


<h2>Annotating C++ and AS3 classes</h2>

<h3>Changing the C++ class head</h3>

<p>To make the class exactly traced change this:
<pre>
  class Derived : public Base ...
</pre>
to one of these:
<pre>
  class GC_<b>AS3</b>_EXACT(Derived, Base) ...   // Has an AS3 counterpart
  class GC_<b>CPP</b>_EXACT(Derived, Base) ...   // Does not have an AS3 counterpart
</pre>

<p>For classes defined within an #ifdef use the _IFDEF variants:
<pre>
  #ifdef <b>DEBUGGER</b>
    class GC_CPP_EXACT_<b>IFDEF</b>(Derived, Base, <b>DEBUGGER</b>) ...
  #endif
</pre>


<h3>Changing the AS3 "native" metadata</h3>

<p>If the class has an AS3 counterpart (if it's "AVM glue") then you need
to change the AS3 class's metadata by inserting a GC argument:
<pre>
  [native(..., <b>gc="exact"</b>, ...)]
  public class Array extends Object { ... }
</pre>

<P>You can choose to make only the C++ class object (<tt>classgc="exact"</tt>)
or instance object (<tt>instancegc="exact"</tt>) exactly traced; typically
you do both, as in the example above (<tt>gc="exact"</tt>).


<h3>Annotating C++ data fields</h3>

<p>To delimit the data section in the C++ class, add these macros around
the member data definitions of Derived:
<pre>
  GC_DATA_BEGIN(Derived)
  ...
  GC_DATA_END(Derived)
</pre>

<P>The redundant use of the class name is very much deliberate: it provides error
checking and allows for nested classes.


<P>Annotate each pointer member in the data section by making each thing
on the left in the table below turn into the thing on the right:
<pre>
  DRCWB(ClassClosure*) p;  |  DRCWB(ClassClosure*) GC_POINTER(p); // untagged pointer
  ATOM_WB a;               |  ATOM_WB GC_ATOM(a);                 // AVM+ atom
  uintptr_t p;             |  uintptr_t GC_POINTER(p);            // tagged pointer with manual barrier
  uintptr_t p;             |  uintptr_t GC_CONSERVATIVE(p);       // maybe pointer, maybe not
</pre>

<P>If the thing on the left is not a pointer, but a structure containing
pointers, you do the same thing:
<pre>
  GCList&lt;Atom> atoms;      |  GCList&lt;Atom> GC_STRUCTURE(p);       // substructure
</pre>

<P>The structure type must implement the exact GC protocol.  All the
predefined "List" types in the AVM+ do; if you need to implement it
for your own type then look below.


<P>If the field is inside an #if or #ifdef or #ifndef block you must use
corresponding annotations:
<pre>
  #ifdef <b>DEBUGGER</b>
    DRCWB(ClassClosure*) GC_POINTER_<b>IFDEF</b>(p, <b>DEBUGGER</b>);
  #endif
</pre>


<h2>Turning on exact GC during instantiation</h2>

<h3>Setting the bit</h3>

<P> It's incorrect to turn on exact GC for an object until the
object has been fully initialized, so that has to be done from the
point where the object is allocated.  There is a templated utility
function, <tt>MMgc::setExact()</tt>, that takes an object pointer and
enables exact GC for it, and then returns the pointer.  Thus
this:
<pre>
  p = new (gc, extra) Fnord(p, q);
</pre>
turns into this:
<pre>
  p = <b>MMgc::setExact</b>(new (gc, extra) Fnord(p, q));
</pre>

<h3>Erecting safeguards</h3>

<P> However, it is <em>strongly encouraged</em> to take this one step
further and ensure that there is exactly one allocation site per
exactly traced object type.  Otherwise, it's far to easy to have some sites that
set the exactly-traced bit and some that don't; while that will work, it's not what you want.

<p> To ensure that there is only one allocation site, make the type's
constructor <tt>protected</tt> or <tt>private</tt>, and create a
factory function for the type.  In the AVM+ most exactly-traced object
types now have a creator function:
<pre>
  REALLY_INLINE static Fnord* create(MMgc::GC* gc, size_t extra, P* p, Q* q) {
    return MMgc::setExact(new (gc, extra) Fnord(p, q));
  }
</pre>
with allocation sites looking like this:
<pre>
  p = Fnord::create(gc, extra, p, q);
</pre>

<P>Frequently, the "extra" argument is derived from one of the other
arguments and that computation can be moved into the creator function.


<h2>Generating code</h2>

<h3>Regenerating tracers</h3>

<p>The tracers for the AVM+ core, the AVM+ shell, and AVM+ used in the
Flash Player are generated by separate scripts.

<p>If you're building the avmshell:
<pre>
  # ( cd core ; ASC=... AVMSHELL=... ./builtin-tracers.py )
  # ( cd shell ; ASC=... AVMSHELL=... ./shell_toplevel-tracers.py )
</pre>

<p>If you're building the Flash Player:
<pre>
  # ( cd third_party/avmplus/core ; ASC=... AVMSHELL=... ./builtin-tracers.py )
  # ( cd flash/utils/exactgc ; ASC=... AVMSHELL=... ./avmglue-tracers.py )
  # ... maybe more here, as tracers are written for non-avmglue classes ...
</pre>

<p><u>Note, there are probably some snags with building the AVM+ tracers
for the Flash Player right now because the Flash Player build
process moves <tt>builtin.abc</tt> away from the <tt>avmplus</tt> directory, yet the
script needs that file; that problem will be resolved in the near
future.</u>


<h3>Regenerating builtins</h3>

<P> This is the standard drill.  In the Flash Player it's done
automatically; in the avmshell you have to do it manually:
<pre>
  # ( cd core ; AVMSHELL=... ./builtin.py )
  # ( cd shell ; AVMSHELL=... ./shell_toplevel.py )
</pre>


<h2>Implementing the GC protocol for structure members</h2>

<P>You must implement a method on the structure called "gcTrace", it
takes a <tt>MMgc::GC*</tt> and returns nothing, and informs the GC of the pointer
fields in the structure.  Currently there's no annotation system for
that.

<p>Suppose the structure (it can be a class, too) looks like this:
<pre>
  struct S {
    int x;
    DRCWB(ScriptObject*) p;  // untagged pointer
    ATOM_WB a;               // AVM+ atom
    uintptr_t q;             // tagged pointer with manual barrier
    uintptr_t w;             // maybe pointer, maybe not
    GCList&lt;Atom> atoms;      // substructure
  }
</pre>

<P>Then you would add this method to its body:
<pre>
    inline void gcTrace(MMgc::GC* gc) {
      gc->TraceAtom(&a);
      gc->TraceLocation(&p);
      gc->TraceLocation(&q);
      gc->TraceConservativeLocation(&w);
      atoms.gcTrace(gc);
    }
</pre>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<P>Some errors are not discovered until run-time, unfortunately (when
they are signaled by crashes, almost uniformly).  We'll continue to
add safeguards to the exact GC infrastructure but there will be
some pitfalls for the foreseeable future.


<P>In particular, you <em>will not</em> get any generation-time or
compile-time errors if:

<ul>
<li>You forget to annotate a field in an exactly traced class.
<li>You forget to run the tracer generation script after adding an annotation.
</ul>

<p> Missing annotations are particularly easy to acquire during
merges, if the author of the merged-in code is unaware that somebody
has transformed the merged-into class to become exactly traced.
