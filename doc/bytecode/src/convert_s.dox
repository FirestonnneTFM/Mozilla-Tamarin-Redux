\subsection description Description

value is popped off of the stack and converted to a string. The result, stringvalue, 
is pushed onto the stack. This uses the ToString algorithm, as described in ECMA-262 section 9.8

This is very similar to the coerce_s opcode. The difference is that coerce_s will not convert 
a null or undefined value to the string "null" or "undefined" whereas convert_s will.
