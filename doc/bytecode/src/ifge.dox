\subsection description Description

offset is an s24 that is the number of bytes to jump if value1 is greater than or equal to value2.

Compute value1 < value2 using the abstract relational comparison algorithm in ECMA-262 
section 11.8.5. If the result of the comparison is false, jump the number of bytes 
indicated by offset. Otherwise continue executing code from this point.
