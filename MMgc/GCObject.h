	 * Base class for reference counted objects.
	 *
	 * This object always has a finalizer (the C++ destructor).  The C++ destructor /must/
	 * leave the object with all-fields-zero.
	 *
	 * Reference counting is deferred: when an object's reference count drops to zero it
	 * is inserted into the zero-count table (the ZCT), see ZCT.h etc.  If the reference 
	 * count grows above zero the object is removed from the ZCT again.  Every new object
	 * is added to the ZCT initially - reference counts start at zero.
	 *
	 * Occasionally the ZCT is reaped: objects in the ZCT that are not referenced from stack
	 * memory or special ZCT roots, and that are not explicitly pinned by client code, are
	 * deleted by calling their finalizers and reclaiming their memory.   A finalizer may
	 * make the reference counts of more referenced objects drop to zero, whereupon they
	 * too are entered into the ZCT (and may be deleted by the ongoing reap, or a later
	 * reap).
	 *
	 * (Under complicated scenarios it is possible for an object allocated during reaping
	 * to be erroneously deleted, see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=506644,
	 * so client code may want to take note of that.)
