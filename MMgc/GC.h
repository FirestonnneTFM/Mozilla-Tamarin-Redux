		 *
		 * Memory is allocated from the heap and not from the stack.  It is freed in 
		 * one of two ways: If the function returns normally then an auto_ptr like
		 * mechanism frees the memory.  If the function leaves by throwing an exception
		 * (or if one of its callees throws an exception) then the exception
		 * handling mechanism in Exception.{h,cpp} frees the memory by releasing 
		 * everything that is still allocated that was allocated since the exception
		 * handler was erected.
		 *
		 * The auto_ptr mechanism, based on the class MMgc::GC::AllocaAutoPtr, cannot be
		 * circumvented, as allocaPush() takes a reference to such an object as an argument.
		 *
		 * Typical usage:
		 *
		 *    MMgc::GC::AllocaAutoPtr _ptr;                      // by convention prefixed by "_"
		 *    int* ptr = (int*)core->allocaPush(_ptr, nbytes);  // by convention same name, no "_"
		 *
		 * In practice the VMPI_alloca() macro, defined in avmbuild.h, should be used so that
		 * real alloca() can be used on platforms where that makes sense.
		 *
		 * Benchmarks suggest that the performance differences from using this mechanism
		 * instead of real alloca() are slight to nonexistent, and that the heap allocation
		 * sometimes provides a performance improvement.
