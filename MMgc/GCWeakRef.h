     * Weak reference type (not exposed to AS3).

     * GC::GetWeakRef(o) will return a unique GCWeakRef instance for the object o, possibly
     * creating that instance.  The weakref instance holds o weakly, that is, if the last 
     * reference to o is from the weakref instance then o becomes reclaimable.
     *
     * The implementation maintains a table of mappings from objects to their weakrefs.
     *
     * When the GC prepares to run finalizers it walks the mappings table.  If a weakref
     * holds an object that is not marked then the weakref is cleared.  If a weakref
     * holds an object that is marked, but the weakref is itself not marked, then the weakref
     * becomes marked, that is, weakrefs live at least as long as their objects.
     *
     * When finalizers run there is no reason to handle weakrefs specially, though GetWeakRef
     * has to check that a weak reference is not created to a dead object by a finalizer.
