The eventual goal is that eval should support the same language as ASC.  This
backlog records all the things we know are not supported; keep it up to date
and pick tasks off it.

Current status: We can run almost all of the ecma3/ and e4x/
acceptance tests from source.

Work list is organized as P1/P2/P3/P4/P5 where P1 is highest and these mean:

  - P1 - basic functionality
  - P2 - rough compatibility with ES3
  - P3 - rough compatibility with AS3 and E4X
  - P4 - quality requirements / subtle semantics
  - P5 - desirable extensions

Note that FIXMEs in the code are generally not noted here.


Lexer:

  P5:
  - triple-quoted strings a la Python/ES4, or @"..." a la C#
  - alternatively, a backtick form would allow us to usurp E4X syntax when
    that is useful, because E4X would be available under backtick.  
	`<foo>...</foo>; `"..."; `if.  Notably we could then do Vector<int>,
	not have to do Vector.<int> (well, there may be other conditions too).


Parser:

  P3:
  - 'package', 'class', and 'interface' are parsed but mainly superficially, see FIXMEs
  - 'public', 'private', 'protected', 'native', 'static', 'prototype', and named NS are parsed but not really used anywhere
  - lots of places that parse by 'identifier()' should parse by something that handles both id and id::id
  - generic types (ie, Vector) 
  - 'super' both stmt and expr
  - getter and setter functions


Code generator:

  P2:
  - return/continue/break out of "finally" clause

  P3:
  - 'import' statement
  - 'const' statement and definition
  - 'use namespace' statement
  - (many more to come, as the parser handles more AS3 constructs)

  P4:
  - Variable definitions must not override function definitions or param definitions
    in the same scope, as per E262-3.  Also there may be some fine points with
	exactly when 'arguments' is initialized.


ABC layer:

  P3:
  - instance
  - class


Code quality, utility, API, etc:

  P4:
  - Transition to VMPI_ forms of libc functions everywhere.  I've converted the code
    but I need to provide macros in the standalone compiler setup as well.  Also note
	that the VMPI layer in Tamarin does not currently provide a mapping for vsnprintf,
	for example.

  - Syntax error messages are more ad-hoc than they need be, probably.  See the
    string constants in eval-compile.cpp.

  - Syntax error messages sometimes provides less information than they need to;
    the "wrong token" error is the worst but others are bad too.

  - Eval code should not use unadorned 'new' for anything; instead the HostContext
    should have alloc() and free() methods for allocating memory.  These should be
	used with placement new or just by themselves as appropriate, and we should
	never use 'delete' for anything.  Nor should there be any use of malloc or
	calloc or similar.  The purpose of this rule is to not depend on the memory
	management provided by new or delete, as they sometimes are diverted to FixedMalloc
	and sometimes not (depending on platform), when eval is embedded in the avm.
	
	Now, Tommy says that we should be moving toward a world where we assume that
	new and delete are overloaded and point to FixedMalloc, but there are some
	platforms where that is actually hard (toolchain issues).  So if there's not
	a lot of work to abstract it out - and there's no reason that it should be
	a lot of work because almost all allocation goes through the Allocator anyway -
	then we should probably do it.  (Would also let us know something about the
	memory consumption of eval.)

  Optimizations:
  - Store local variables in registers if the function does not close over
    other functions and does not use 'with' (at least) - ESC implemented this,
	it yields significant performance improvements
	
  - Reuse locals of the same type; right now we generate a lot of local slots
    in order not to annoy the verifier, but doing better would result in lower
	stack consumption
	
  - Improved scope stack tracking.  Right now the code generator just sums the
    number of PUSHSCOPE and PUSHWITH instructions, which yields a conservative
	approximation to the actual depth.  Probably pretty close in practice,
	but in a function with a lot of exception handlers it may be a substantial
	overestimate because there will be PUSHSCOPE/PUSHWITH instructions to reconstruct
	the scope stack inside each handler.
	
  - OP_dxns instead of OP_dxnslate when the argument is a string or the name
    of a namespace definition.

  - namespace qualifiers should be inserted literally when they are known at
    compile time, not result in RTName code generation


Test harness:

  - need tests for eval function, too


Documentation bugs:

  - AS3 docs list 'to' as a keyword but test suite uses 'to' as an identifier.


Bug triage (open bugs):

  - These are the same problem:

		ecma3/ExecutionContexts/e10_1_4_10.as : FAILED contained no testcase messages - reason: 10.1.4-10 Scope Chain and Identifier Resolution
		 | TypeError: Error #1004: Method Number.prototype.toString was invoked on an incompatible object.
		 | at Error$/throwError()
		 | at <anonymous>()
		 | at getTestCases()[ecma3/ExecutionContexts/e10_1_4_10.as:58]
		 | at global$init()[ecma3/ExecutionContexts/e10_1_4_10.as:43]
		ecma3/Statements/e12_10.as : FAILED contained no testcase messages - reason:
		 | TypeError: Error #1004: Method Number.prototype.valueOf was invoked on an incompatible object.
		 | at Error$/throwError()
		 | at <anonymous>()
		 | at getTestCases()[ecma3/Statements/e12_10.as:53]
		 | at global$init()[ecma3/Statements/e12_10.as:42]

	The structure is "with (new Number(x)) toString()" - or valueOf.


Tests in the 'ecma3' test suite that can't pass at this time:

  - ecmas3/LexicalConventions/e7_1_1.as fails with a syntax error because
    a no-break space encoded in some strange way in a comment trips up the
	the UTF8 decoder in the string class.  Instead of detecting invalid
	UTF8 content and letting my code fall back on Latin-1 it decodes it 
	but screws the decoding up, so final characters are missing and the parse
	fails.

  - string-to-number conversion:
	   ecma3/GlobalObject/e15_1_2_2_2.as
	   ecma3/GlobalObject/e15_1_2_2_2.as
	   ecma3/GlobalObject/e15_1_2_2_2.as
	   ecma3/LexicalConventions/e7_7_3.as
	   ecma3/LexicalConventions/e7_7_3.as
	   ecma3/LexicalConventions/e7_7_3.as
	   ecma3/LexicalConventions/e7_7_3.as
	   ecma3/Number/e15_7_3_2_1.as
	   ecma3/Number/e15_7_3_2_2.as
	   ecma3/Number/e15_7_3_2_3.as
	   ecma3/ObjectObjects/e15_2_1_1_rt.as
	   ecma3/String/e15_5_4_7_2.as
	   ecma3/TypeConversion/e9_3.as
	   ecma3/TypeConversion/e9_9_1_rt.as
     The largest number the built-in parser will parse as a non-infinity is 1.7976931348623145e308.
	 But the test cases assume that 1.7976931348623157e308 will be parsed as non-infinity, and
	 the number parser in ASC does this.  Some test cases can be fixed by replacing the latter
	 literal by Number.MAX_VALUE.

  - uses 'class':
     ecma3/Expressions/e11_2_2_1.as
     ecma3/Expressions/e11_2_4.as
     ecma3/Expressions/e11_4_3.as
     ecma3/Expressions/e11_9_4.as
     ecma3/Expressions/e11_9_5.as
     ecma3/Statements/e12_6_3_12.as
     ecma3/RegExp/eregress_122076.as

  - uses 'import':
     ecma3/ObjectObjects/class_006.as ("import flash.system.Capabilities")

  - uses 'use namespace':
     ecma3/String/e15_5_3_2_1.as
     ecma3/String/e15_5_4_6_2_rt.as

  - probably incorrect test:
     ecma3/TypeConversion/e9_3_1_3_rt.as - wants \0 in a string to turn into a digit '0' but E262-3
       explicitly sanctions \0 as a valid escape sequence that turns into NUL


Tests in the e4x test suite that fail for apparently no fault of eval:

  - fail with the JIT but not with the interpreter:

	  shell.as e4x/shell.as e4x/Statements/e12_1.as : 2 =  FAILED! expected: <soap:Body xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
	  shell.as e4x/shell.as e4x/Statements/e12_1.as : 3 = <Envelope soap:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/" xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"><Body><stock:GetLastTradePrice xmlns:stock="http://mycompany.com/stocks"><stock:symbol>DIS</stock:symbol></stock:GetLastTradePrice></Body><soap:Body><stock:GetLastTradePrice xmlns:stock="http://mycompany.com/stocks"><stock:symbol>MYCO</stock:symbol></stock:GetLastTradePrice></soap:Body></Envelope> FAILED! expected: <soap:Envelope soap:encodingStyle="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/" xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/"><soap:Body><stock:GetLastTradePrice xmlns:stock="http://mycompany.com/stocks"><stock:symbol>MYCO</stock:symbol></stock:GetLastTradePrice></soap:Body></soap:Envelope>
	  shell.as e4x/shell.as e4x/Statements/e12_1.as : 6 =  FAILED! expected: http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/
	  shell.as e4x/shell.as e4x/Statements/e12_1.as : 7 =  FAILED! expected: http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/
	  shell.as e4x/shell.as e4x/Statements/e12_1.as : 9 =  FAILED! expected: http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/
	  shell.as e4x/shell.as e4x/Statements/e12_1.as : 14 =  FAILED! expected: bar
	  shell.as e4x/shell.as e4x/Statements/e12_1.as : Namespaces in global scope:  = 0 FAILED! expected: 3

    However the interpreter has other failures (it fails #7 outright), and it looks
	like the wrong code is generated for property references.  I translate a.x as
	a.public::x but E4X really wants a.*::x.  This seems like a dangerous fix in
	general unless * translates as "public" for the purposes of non-E4X objects,
	so who knows what's actually going on here.  It's possible that there's magic
	somewhere in Tamarin to handle * as * for E4X and as [public] for everyone
	else.
