This directory contains code for an ES4 compiler for tamarin 
written in ES4. The code is in a formidable stage and so is 
prone to raising unhandled exceptions. But here are some
things you might want to do with it anyway.

RUNNING

A set of last known good .abc files is provided in the ./bin 
directory so you can run the compiler out of the box. There
isn't much you can do with it that is interesting, but there
you are.

  cd build
  ./main.sh      enter simple expressions at the 'es>' prompt

BUILDING

Various hard coded scripts are provided to run ESC on the ES4-RI
and on Tamarin. Our job is to get the mother script, comp-esc.sh,
to run to completion without errors. For now it serves as a kind
of roadmap of what needs to get done.

  cd build
  ./comp-esc.sh  requires the ES4-RI heap to be installed and 
                 various hard coded paths to be edited, commands 
                 that build out of date targets to be uncommented

CONTRIBUTING

If you are so inclined and have a lot of time on your hands, 
figure out how to get a working version of the ES4-RI on your 
machine, build a debug version of tamarin, and help us run down 
the remaining verification and runtime errors that are keeping
comp-esc.sh from completing successfully.
