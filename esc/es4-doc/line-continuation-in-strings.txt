TEST CASE:  Implemented


DESCRIPTION

The character sequence BACKSLASH <lineterminator> (where
<lineterminator> will be one of the characters LF, LS, or PS) is
removed from strings delimited by either single or triple SINGLEQUOTE
or DOUBLEQUOTE characters.  (Triple-quoting is defined in [5].)


OPEN ISSUES

Should this apply in triply quoted strings?  The wiki says no, the RI
says yes.  I've gone with the RI because the "optimization" described
in the wiki is probably going to be counterintuitive to most users and
of effectively no value.  See longer discussion below.

The RI does not handle BACKSLASH LS or BACKSLASH PS, but [1] seems to
indicate that it's the intent to handle them (it references
LineTerminator, which includes these characters), so I've gone with
the wiki.


DISCUSSION

This feature comes from the bug fix [BACKSLASH.NEWLINE.IN.STRING] in
[1], applying to strings only (not regular expression literals,
identifiers, or block comments, which would be other obvious places,
nor generally as a transformation that would take place before
tokenization).

Its application to triply quoted strings [3] was discussed in [2],
where it was proposed that there would be no removal of BACKSLASH
<lineterminator> in those strings, but that the sequence would just
turn into the literal <lineterminator> character, like other white
space.  The argument was that since removal was not needed in those
strings then it was also not wanted.

The RI scanner actually removes BACKSLASH <lineterminator> in triply
quoted strings.  I believe this is probably the desired behavior,
which is why it has been described above.

Note that it is probably not necessary to have this feature in regexp
literals because the new scanning rules for ES4 allows linebreaks with
the "x" flag.  The absence of support is a little jarring IMO.
