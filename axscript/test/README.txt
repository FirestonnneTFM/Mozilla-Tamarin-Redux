This is the readme for axtam tests.
-----------------------------------

You will currently find one test for Internet Explorer, and one for the 
Windows Scripting Host.

* To test with the Windows Scripting Host (WSH), execute:
  % cscript.exe /E:application/ecmascript;version=4 wsh_simple.es4

* To test with Internet Explorer, load 'simple.html' in the browser.  In IE7,
  it will be necessary to enable the engine via the information bar.

Note that the only way to see output generated by axtam.System.write is to
either execute this under the debugger and look at the Output Window, or to
execute a script host with a valid stdout handle.  cscript.exe is a console
version of the Windows Scripting Host, so does have a valid stdout - hence 
it is recommended for testing.

Script Errors (ie, errors in the code passed by the engine) are passed back to
the script host (ie, WSH or IE).  However, IE7 disables script error messages 
by default, so all errors will tend to pass silently.  If you select 
Tools->Internet Options->Advanced and enable "Display a notification about 
every script error" you will be able to see any such errors.
