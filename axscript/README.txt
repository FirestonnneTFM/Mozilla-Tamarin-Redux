This is the readme for axtam - Active Scripting implemented using Tamarin.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is still very early - almost nothing works yet!  See the 'axscript/test'
directory, where things will generally be more up-to-date than this README 
is; currently tested are IE and WSH.

Building
---------

* Build the standard tamarim 'avmplus' project.  This will create the core
  tamarin static libraries used by axtam.

* Load axtam.dsp into Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 - there is no support for 
  earlier versions.  Select the same configuration you used for avmplus.

* Build it - a custom build step will also register the engine.  Only debug builds
  work - release builds haven't even been tried.

After this, an engine named 'application/javascript;version=4' is available.
Note that no file extension is currently registered for this engine, so this
engine name will need to be explicitly specified.

Test it
--------

See the test directory, but to get started:

* To test with the Windows Scripting Host (WSH), execute:
  % cscript.exe /E:application/javascript;version=4 wsh_simple.es4

* To test with Internet Explorer, load 'simple.html' in the browser.

All filenames are relative to the 'axscript/test' directory.

Note that the only way to see output generated by axtam.System.write is to
either execute this under the debugger and look at the Output Window, or to
execute a script host with a valid stdout handle.  cscript.exe is a console
version of the Windows Scripting Host, so does have a valid stdout - hence 
it is recommended for testing.
