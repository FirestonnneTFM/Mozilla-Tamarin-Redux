        @type  svnurl: string
        @param svnurl: the SVN URL that describes the repository and
                       subdirectory to watch. If this ChangeSource should
                       only pay attention to a single branch, this should
                       point at the repository for that branch, like
                       svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk . If it
                       should follow multiple branches, point it at the
                       repository directory that contains all the branches
                       like svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted and also
                       provide a branch-determining function.

                       Each file in the repository has a SVN URL in the form
                       (SVNURL)/(BRANCH)/(FILEPATH), where (BRANCH) could be
                       empty or not, depending upon your branch-determining
                       function. Only files that start with (SVNURL)/(BRANCH)
                       will be monitored. The Change objects that are sent to
                       the Schedulers will see (FILEPATH) for each modified
                       file.

        @type  split_file: callable or None
        @param split_file: a function that is called with a string of the
                           form (BRANCH)/(FILEPATH) and should return a tuple
                           (BRANCH, FILEPATH). This function should match
                           your repository's branch-naming policy. Each
                           changed file has a fully-qualified URL that can be
                           split into a prefix (which equals the value of the
                           'svnurl' argument) and a suffix; it is this suffix
                           which is passed to the split_file function.

                           If the function returns None, the file is ignored.
                           Use this to indicate that the file is not a part
                           of this project.
                           
                           For example, if your repository puts the trunk in
                           trunk/... and branches are in places like
                           branches/1.5/..., your split_file function could
                           look like the following (this function is
                           available as svnpoller.split_file_branches)::

                            pieces = path.split('/')
                            if pieces[0] == 'trunk':
                                return (None, '/'.join(pieces[1:]))
                            elif pieces[0] == 'branches':
                                return ('/'.join(pieces[0:2]),
                                        '/'.join(pieces[2:]))
                            else:
                                return None

                           If instead your repository layout puts the trunk
                           for ProjectA in trunk/ProjectA/... and the 1.5
                           branch in branches/1.5/ProjectA/..., your
                           split_file function could look like::

                            pieces = path.split('/')
                            if pieces[0] == 'trunk':
                                branch = None
                                pieces.pop(0) # remove 'trunk'
                            elif pieces[0] == 'branches':
                                pieces.pop(0) # remove 'branches'
                                # grab branch name
                                branch = 'branches/' + pieces.pop(0)
                            else:
                                return None # something weird
                            projectname = pieces.pop(0)
                            if projectname != 'ProjectA':
                                return None # wrong project
                            return (branch, '/'.join(pieces))

                           The default of split_file= is None, which
                           indicates that no splitting should be done. This
                           is equivalent to the following function::

                            return (None, path)

                           If you wish, you can override the split_file
                           method with the same sort of function instead of
                           passing in a split_file= argument.


        @type  svnuser:      string
        @param svnuser:      If set, the --username option will be added to
                             the 'svn log' command. You may need this to get
                             access to a private repository.
        @type  svnpasswd:    string
        @param svnpasswd:    If set, the --password option will be added.

        @type  pollinterval: int
        @param pollinterval: interval in seconds between polls. The default
                             is 600 seconds (10 minutes). Smaller values
                             decrease the latency between the time a change
                             is recorded and the time the buildbot notices
                             it, but it also increases the system load.

        @type  histmax:      int
        @param histmax:      maximum number of changes to look back through.
                             The default is 100. Smaller values decrease
                             system load, but if more than histmax changes
                             are recorded between polls, the extra ones will
                             be silently lost.

        @type  svnbin:       string
        @param svnbin:       path to svn binary, defaults to just 'svn'. Use
                             this if your subversion command lives in an
                             unusual location.
