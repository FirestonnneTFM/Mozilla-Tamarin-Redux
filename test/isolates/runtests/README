This is a very simple test harness to run the Tamarin acceptance tests using
Workers.  The number of workers spawned can be controlled in the test source.

The runtests.abc file will load "tests.txt" in the current directory and
will then run all of the tests.  There is no attempt to verify the output
of the test (Pass/Fail) but is currently intended to just stress test Workers.

Note that the tests.txt file can not have any blank lines.
