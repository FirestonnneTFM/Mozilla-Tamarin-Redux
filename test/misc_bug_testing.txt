# file contains a list of tests to run

# directory , commands ...

# directory = directory to start, most test suites require starting in the directory
# commands = all commands and parameters to run testsuite
# any variable enclosed as ${var} will be replaced with the environment variable
# the common shell variables are: py, avmr, avmrd, avmd, avmd   
#     (py=python r=release, rd=release-debugger, d=debug, dd=debug-debugger)
#
# windows platforms using native python have problems in subprocess.Popen. 
# follow these guidelines:
# - do not use ./ unless it is a parameter to an executable 
#   e.g. do not use cd ./acceptance
#        do use ${PYTHON_RUNTESTS} ./runtests.py ...
# - specify python with the ${PYTHON_RUNTESTS} environment variable

#  running release-debugger vm shell with -Dnoincgc crashes on several performance tests
