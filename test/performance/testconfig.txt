# fields are: TESTNAME, CONFIGURATION, COMMANDS, DETAILS
# each field separate by , and whitespace is removed before/after from each field
#
# TESTNAME may contain : testcase (for the vm tests) : (colon) is the separator
# TESTNAME and testcase are regular expressions and can match multiple test files / test cases
#
# CONFIGURATION is also a regular expression
# CONFIGURATION format is {CPU_ARCH}-{OS}-{VM}-{VERSION}-{VMSWITCH}
#
# COMMANDS are currently : asc.args, expectedfailu, skip
#    skip - the test is not run, for example the configuration does not support a feature or the
#           file is not a test and is a helper file to another test
#    include - only run include files for given configuration.
#              if include is set, only the files specified by the include for the given 
#              configuration will run, all other files will be skipped
