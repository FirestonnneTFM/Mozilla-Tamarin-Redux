/* A somewhat nasty program.
 *
 * When run, ofib allocates 10946 new dynamic objects, and the largest
 * number of live objects (21 separate full structures) is 229866
 * objects.  Each object occupies at least 9 words plus 16 words for
 * the hash table's atoms table (the default capacity is 8), make it
 * 26 words for a total of 23906064 bytes.  This is the lower bound on
 * the amount of live data.  (Needs experimental verification, and
 * note the hash table size is subject to change.)
 *
 * The structure is entirely circular and utterly impervious to standard
 * reference counting - GC is needed to release it.
 *
 * The test is artificial and meant to stress the GC maximally, but if
 * you're charitable you can imagine the program as the abstraction of
 * one that manipulates a bunch of cached data structures where evicted
 * structures must be garbage collected.
