/* A somewhat nasty program.
 *
 * When run, ofib-rc allocates 10946 new dynamic objects, and the largest
 * number of live objects (21 separate full structures) is 229866
 * objects.  Each object occupies at least 9 words plus 16 words for
 * the hash table's atoms table (the default capacity is 8), make it
 * 26 words for a total of 23906064 bytes.  This is the lower bound on
 * the amount of live data.  (Needs experimental verification, and
 * note the hash table size is subject to change.)
 *
 * The structure is entirely tree shaped and reference counting can
 * remove all of it without any need for GC - as long as the GC does
 * not intervene.
 *
 * The test is highly artificial and meant to stress the ZCT reaper
 * maximally, and the funny construction with the tmp array is the way
 * it is to trigger reaping.  Even so this test could be thwarted
 * if the GC is running at the time a reap should have been triggered.
