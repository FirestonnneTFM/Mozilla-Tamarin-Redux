This is a placeholder file, present only to force runtests.py to test mops.abc, 
which tests direct-memory-access opcodes. As there is no publicly available compiler
for these opcodes at this time, mops.abc is provided in binary-only form for now.

This file will be replaced with a real source file when an appropriate compiler is available.
