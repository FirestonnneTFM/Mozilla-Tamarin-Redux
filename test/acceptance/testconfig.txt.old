# DOCUMENTATION:
#    the acceptance/testconfig.txt controls when test files and test cases are marked as expected failure and skip for a specific configuration.
#
#    the general format for non-comment lines in this file is comma separated:
#       test ,  configuration  ,  command (expectedfailure, skip,include)   ,  comments
#
# test is a regular expression consisting of path to file relative from test/acceptance  ':' (separator) testcase
#
# configuration is a regular expression with the format {CPU_ARCH}-{OS}-{VM}-{VERSION}-{VMSWITCH}
#
# commands are currently one of : asc.args, expectedfail, skip, include
#    expectedfail - expects the test to fail, comments should provide bug number and a comment
#
#    The following commands only operate at a testfile level and not individual tests:
#
#    skip - the test is not run, for example the configuration does not support
#           a feature or the file is not a test and is a helper file to another test
#    include - includes a specific testcase even if the parent has been skipped
#              overrides any skip command defined for the same configuration
#    ats_skip - don't generate an ATS swf as these files are not ATS compatible
#    verify_skip - skip test when doing a verify run
#
# comments: please include bug reference, date, and reason for the entry

# NOTES:
# Filename matching:
#    When more than one test/filename regexp matches, we choose to match to the longest regexp
#    e.g:
#       given someDir/.* and someDir/myTestname
#       someDir/myTestname will take precedence since it has longer total length
#
# To specify that a configuration string DOES NOT contain certain strings use Zero-width negative lookahead: (?!regex)
#    For example, to set an expected failure for all test runs EXCEPT when -Dinterp is used, use the following:
#    ^((?!Dinterp).)*$
