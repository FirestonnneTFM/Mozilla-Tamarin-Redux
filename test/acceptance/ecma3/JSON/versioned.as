// The point of this test is to ensure that old content that
// defines a JSON class in one file and uses that class in
// another file all continues to run properly when run
// in a dynamic context before version SWF_13.

// This is the file that drives the test.  It is designed
// so that it can be compiled by the current tool chain
// regardless of the current tool chain's version.
// The legacy content is kept in two .abc files that have
// been compiled with asc and a set of builtins before JSON
// was added to the builtins.

startTest();

// versioned_defjson_helper.as_ and versioned_useoldjson_helper.as_ were
// both compiled with builtins _before_ JSON was added.  
// to recompile the helper files sync to tr 6199
// rename the abc files to
// versioned_defjson_helper.abc_bin and versioned_useoldjson_helper.abc_bin

// the versioned.as.avm_args runs this test with:
//   -api SWF_12 ecma3/JSON/versioned_defjson_helper.abc_bin ecma3/JSON/versioned_useoldjson_helper.abc_bin
