   File Name:    lastindexof.es
   Description:  lastindexOf(object,value,from=...)
     compares value with every vector element of object in increasing numerical index order, starting at the
     index from, stopping when an vector lement is equial to value by the === operator, From is rounded toward zero
     before use.  If from is negative, it is treated as object.length+from, returns vector index from first value or -1
     if no such element is found.
