/*
The NumericLiteral rule of the lexical grammar (lines 160-161) is extended as follows:
NumericLiteral
...
FloatLiteral
FloatLiteral
DecimalLiteral f
The letter f is the Unicode letter "LATIN-SMALL-LETTER-F", code point 102. (As is normal in the
lexical grammar, no white space or other token separator is allowed between DecimalLiteral and the
letter f.)
For example,
1f
31.4159e-1f
Note: The suffix f appears only in the surface lexical syntax. It is not understood by ToNumeric or
ToFloat. It is not produced by any function that converts a float to a string, notably ToString. Finally,
it is not understood by the parseFloat operator (where it would break backward compatibility by
returning a non-Number for a number value that happened to be followed by the character f, where
that f would previously be uninterpreted). See the rationale for a longer discussion of these issues.
Implementation note: The ABC format has been revised to provide a section for float constant values
as well as a pushfloat instructions.
