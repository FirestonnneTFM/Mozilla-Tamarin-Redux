// Vector.<float4> smoketest.  Tests that vectors are initialized to
// zero, that reading and writing works, that the data written can be
// read again, and that we're not scribbling on memory.
//
// Run this with -Ojit and -Dinterp in a Debug build; the debugging
// functionality in MMgc will catch memory overwrites, should they
// occur.
//
// We test for a lot of different vector lengths, and with and without
// type information, in order to test more JIT and runtime paths.
