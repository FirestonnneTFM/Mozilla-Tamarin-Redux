/* Test case for Bugzilla 678952.  The hypothesis is that additional type
 * information in the verifier can change the meaning of the program in
 * certain synthetic programs that push objects on the scope chain: if the
 * static type of the object was previously *, but now is C, then early binding
 * in the verifier will find a property present in C that was previously 
 * invisible during scope search.
 *
 * The change in Bugzilla 678952 propagates static type information for objects 
 * read from vectors and would therefore cause such a change in meaning.  This
 * program demonstrates that the change in meaning is real.
