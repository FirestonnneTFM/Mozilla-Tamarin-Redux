abcasm is an ABC assembler.

Usage: see abcasm.sh

Syntax: the assembler language is based on abcdump's output format.

Hacking: rebuilding the parser requires antlr-3.0.1 and antlr-2.7.7 
(ANTLR to be upgraded to version 3.1).
Put the paths to the ANTLR jarfiles in a build.properties file, e.g.

# ANTLR grammar regeneration support
# Note both ANTLR3 and ANTLR 2.7.7 are required.
lib.dir=C:/work/antlr-3.0.1
lib2.dir=C:/work/antlr-2.7.7
